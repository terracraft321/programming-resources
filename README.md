"Working effectively with legacy code" by Michael C. Feathers was (and is) a practical book.
A PHILOSOPHY OF SOFTWARE DESIGN by Osterhout.
"When I was in university (back when the dinosaurs ruled the earth), required reading was The Elements of Programming Style by Kernighan and Plauger.  Forty one years of active software development, and that monograph still occupies a prominent spot on my bookshelf.  I favor a style that is based on a top-to-bottom clear and logical progression of statements, using loops and select/case (or equivalent) elements that are designed to reduce the cyclomatic complexity of the code.  My primary rule is never to enforce policy at a point too deep in the hierarchy of logical functions.  I avoid side effects, even in loop controls, and stay away from overly complex idioms.
"Unit Testing Principles, Practices, and Patterns. Though its name suggests it's about unit testing, it's actually about so much more than this, including clean code and clean architecture. We are going through this book at work right now, and it incites a lot of discussions."
""Refactoring to Patterns" by Joshua Kerievsky.

" think one should read Clean Code but one should read Refactoring and Pragmatic Programmer and Clean Architecture and so on. As the authors of The Pragmatic Programmer suggest that if possible, you should read at least one technical book per month while not forgetting about the non-technical books. In the end, they all expand your understanding and it is left as an excercise to the reader to weed out the do's and don't's from each of them."

If you're interested in architecture, anything by Martin Fowler is solid. Likewise if you're just interested in paper anything by Robert C Martin is good although "Design Principles and Design Patterns" is one of his best.

The Phoenix Project and The Unicorn Project
The Pragmatic Programmer. Recommended to me early in my career, this excellent read will teach you the process of software engineering from a practical, business-oriented perspective.
Working Effectively With Legacy Code. While to this day I still have yet to work on a team that does TDD properly, the techniques described in this book have proven invaluable to me while learning new codebases and deciding where I want to start implementing my own changes.
Peopleware - because understanding how teams and management work is valuable even if you don't aspire to manage a team yourself.
Mythical Man-Month, for sure. First published in 1975, and people managing software projects are STILL making the mistakes covered in it because of corporate dysfunction and short-term thinking. If software engineering is ever to move forward into maturity, we have to impress upon newcomers the importance of not just perfecting small-scale craft, but the more philosophical issues of the discipline.

Something about the command line if you’re not really comfortable with it yet. I like The Linux Command Line by Will Shotts as an ebook and think it’s worth the price and reading it front to back. But it’s also up free as a website.
I’d recommend the mostly adequate guide to functional programming even if you are not working in a functional paradigm, at least the first 6-7 chapters. Thinking about pure functions and immutable data are really valuable even working in an OOO setting (I primarily work in Java).
As others have said, Designing Data Intensive Applications is a must read, although I think you’ll get more out of it after a year or two of work experience.
I’ve seen others recommend Effective Java, and I have used this as a reference at times, but I wouldn’t recommend reading it front to back

Programming Interview Exposed
Cracking The Coding Interview
There are many ways to learn how to program, the ways i suggest here might not work for you, i suggest you try it, and if you don't enjoy it, or learn from it, try it a different way. Just don't give up
I started off with a sandbox, changed a few values, made a new blob (a ball). I had the idea to make a gamemode out of the ball, called dodgeball. This goal made me learn how kag works, as i had to explore different gamemode rules, how archer code worked etc. So i advise you come up with something simple for your first gamemode, and make steps towards it. If you ever need help, just ask in help 

How do i learn then?
There are a few ways, the way i learnt was getting the basics from a website like codecademy, and just stopping and moving onto messing around kag. 
I recommend you learn what variables are, how they work, what methods are and loops
Do this with any language you'd like, Angelscript wont be there for most sites, I'd recommend something like C# or Python to begin with

10 Books Every Effective Engineer Should Read
Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams by software consultants Tom
DeMarco and Timothy Lister. First published in 1987, this book discusses
the many dynamics within projects and teams, presenting ideas backed up
by actual research. Though somewhat dated, the book provides many
pearls of wisdom, like how imposing overtime can destroy a team’s ability
to gel and how listening to music while programming can interfere with
our ability to focus. Peopleware started me on my path toward thinking
about how to build effective engineering teams and great engineering
cultures.
Team Geek: A Software Developer’s Guide to Working Well with Others
by Brian W. Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman. In this book, two
Googlers who founded Google’s Chicago engineering office share stories
and insights about how to work well with your fellow engineers. Covering
strategies on how to deal with managers or poisonous team members, and
discussing both patterns and anti-patterns on how to lead teams, it’s a
worthwhile book for any growing engineer to read.
High Output Management by Andrew S. Grove. Grove, the former CEO
of Intel, introduced me to the language of leverage and provided me with
the lens that I now use to allocate my time. Don’t be turned off by the
word “management” in the title. His advice on how to increase your
output is relevant to both people managers as well as to those he calls
“know-how managers”—people like senior engineers who hold much of
the valued knowledge within an organization.
Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity by David Allen.
This book thoroughly describes a concrete implementation of how to
manage to-dos and task lists. While I don’t subscribe to all of Allen’s
ideas, it was eye-opening to read about one possible way of doing things.
If you don’t have a good workflow for prioritizing and getting things
done, this book can provide you with a baseline.
The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New
Rich by Timothy Ferriss. Regardless of whether you actually choose to
subscribe to the type of extreme lifestyle that Ferriss advocates, this book
will teach you two things. First, it shows what’s possible if you
relentlessly prioritize your work and focus on the 10% of effort that
produces most of your gains. Second, it drives home the importance of
creating sustainable systems with low maintenance. That’s a lesson that’s
often underemphasized in engineering, where our inclination to build new
features with the latest sexy technologies doesn’t necessarily take into
account the cost of future maintenance.
The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal
Change by Stephen R. Covey. I’m not actually a fan of Covey’s writing
style—much of it is a little too abstract and fluffy—but the lasting impact
of the ideas in the book compensate for it. From Covey’s third habit of
“putting first things first,” I learned that people tend to neglect important
but non-urgent activities and spend a lot of time dealing with tasks like
emails, phone calls, and meetings that may be urgent but ultimately
unimportant. A key takeaway from this habit is to explicitly budget time
to invest in yourself, whether it’s by learning new skills, maintaining
relationships, reading, etc.
Conscious Business: How to Build Value Through Values by Fred
Kofman. Kofman taught leadership seminars at companies like Facebook
and Google, and his book transformed how I approach difficult
conversations with others. Through simple language and well-constructed
hypotheticals, Kofman demonstrates that we often conflate the facts of a
situation and our own interpretations, resulting in unproductive
conversations. Only by separating fact from story can we actually have
those difficult conversations where we achieve our goals.
Your Brain at Work: Strategies for Overcoming Distraction, Regaining
Focus, and Working Smarter All Day Long by David Rock. In this easyto-read book, Rock combines research on the brain’s functions with
actionable advice on how to work more effectively around the brain’s
limitations. For instance, this book taught me that because prioritization is
a difficult but high-leverage activity that requires substantial cognitive
effort, it’s best done at the beginning of the day.
Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihály
Csíkszentmihályi. In this book, Csíkszentmihályi, a Hungarian professor
and the world’s leading researcher on positive psychology, summarizes
years of research on what’s required to make someone feel fulfilled and
motivated. Criteria include a quick feedback loop, an appropriate level of
challenge, and an absence of interruptions. Given how much time we
spend working, being conscious of these requirements as we go from job
to job and from project to project is very valuable.
Succeed: How We Can Reach Our Goals by Heidi Grant Halvorson.
Halvorson discusses different frameworks for thinking about goals and
how to best frame a goal to increase our chances of success. When is it
helpful to be optimistic versus pessimistic in a goal? Is it better to think
about why you want to achieve a certain goal, or to think about what steps
are necessary to achieve it? Should you visualize what you might gain
from achieving a goal or what you might lose by failing to achieve it? It
turns out that depending on the type of goal, different ways of mentally
framing the goal can significantly affect your chances for success.
