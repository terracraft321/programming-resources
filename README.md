"Working effectively with legacy code" by Michael C. Feathers was (and is) a practical book.
A PHILOSOPHY OF SOFTWARE DESIGN by Osterhout.
"When I was in university (back when the dinosaurs ruled the earth), required reading was The Elements of Programming Style by Kernighan and Plauger.  Forty one years of active software development, and that monograph still occupies a prominent spot on my bookshelf.  I favor a style that is based on a top-to-bottom clear and logical progression of statements, using loops and select/case (or equivalent) elements that are designed to reduce the cyclomatic complexity of the code.  My primary rule is never to enforce policy at a point too deep in the hierarchy of logical functions.  I avoid side effects, even in loop controls, and stay away from overly complex idioms.
"Unit Testing Principles, Practices, and Patterns. Though its name suggests it's about unit testing, it's actually about so much more than this, including clean code and clean architecture. We are going through this book at work right now, and it incites a lot of discussions."
""Refactoring to Patterns" by Joshua Kerievsky.

" think one should read Clean Code but one should read Refactoring and Pragmatic Programmer and Clean Architecture and so on. As the authors of The Pragmatic Programmer suggest that if possible, you should read at least one technical book per month while not forgetting about the non-technical books. In the end, they all expand your understanding and it is left as an excercise to the reader to weed out the do's and don't's from each of them."

The Pragmatic Programmer. Recommended to me early in my career, this excellent read will teach you the process of software engineering from a practical, business-oriented perspective.
Working Effectively With Legacy Code. While to this day I still have yet to work on a team that does TDD properly, the techniques described in this book have proven invaluable to me while learning new codebases and deciding where I want to start implementing my own changes.
Peopleware - because understanding how teams and management work is valuable even if you don't aspire to manage a team yourself.
Mythical Man-Month, for sure. First published in 1975, and people managing software projects are STILL making the mistakes covered in it because of corporate dysfunction and short-term thinking. If software engineering is ever to move forward into maturity, we have to impress upon newcomers the importance of not just perfecting small-scale craft, but the more philosophical issues of the discipline.

Something about the command line if you’re not really comfortable with it yet. I like The Linux Command Line by Will Shotts as an ebook and think it’s worth the price and reading it front to back. But it’s also up free as a website.
I’d recommend the mostly adequate guide to functional programming even if you are not working in a functional paradigm, at least the first 6-7 chapters. Thinking about pure functions and immutable data are really valuable even working in an OOO setting (I primarily work in Java).
As others have said, Designing Data Intensive Applications is a must read, although I think you’ll get more out of it after a year or two of work experience.
I’ve seen others recommend Effective Java, and I have used this as a reference at times, but I wouldn’t recommend reading it front to back

Programming Interview Exposed
Cracking The Coding Interview
There are many ways to learn how to program, the ways i suggest here might not work for you, i suggest you try it, and if you don't enjoy it, or learn from it, try it a different way. Just don't give up
I started off with a sandbox, changed a few values, made a new blob (a ball). I had the idea to make a gamemode out of the ball, called dodgeball. This goal made me learn how kag works, as i had to explore different gamemode rules, how archer code worked etc. So i advise you come up with something simple for your first gamemode, and make steps towards it. If you ever need help, just ask in help 

How do i learn then?
There are a few ways, the way i learnt was getting the basics from a website like codecademy, and just stopping and moving onto messing around kag. 
I recommend you learn what variables are, how they work, what methods are and loops
Do this with any language you'd like, Angelscript wont be there for most sites, I'd recommend something like C# or Python to begin with

10 Books Every Effective Engineer Should Read
Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams by software consultants Tom
DeMarco and Timothy Lister. First published in 1987, this book discusses
the many dynamics within projects and teams, presenting ideas backed up
by actual research. Though somewhat dated, the book provides many
pearls of wisdom, like how imposing overtime can destroy a team’s ability
to gel and how listening to music while programming can interfere with
our ability to focus. Peopleware started me on my path toward thinking
about how to build effective engineering teams and great engineering
cultures.
Team Geek: A Software Developer’s Guide to Working Well with Others
by Brian W. Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman. In this book, two
Googlers who founded Google’s Chicago engineering office share stories
and insights about how to work well with your fellow engineers. Covering
strategies on how to deal with managers or poisonous team members, and
discussing both patterns and anti-patterns on how to lead teams, it’s a
worthwhile book for any growing engineer to read.
High Output Management by Andrew S. Grove. Grove, the former CEO
of Intel, introduced me to the language of leverage and provided me with
the lens that I now use to allocate my time. Don’t be turned off by the
word “management” in the title. His advice on how to increase your
output is relevant to both people managers as well as to those he calls
“know-how managers”—people like senior engineers who hold much of
the valued knowledge within an organization.
Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity by David Allen.
This book thoroughly describes a concrete implementation of how to
manage to-dos and task lists. While I don’t subscribe to all of Allen’s
ideas, it was eye-opening to read about one possible way of doing things.
If you don’t have a good workflow for prioritizing and getting things
done, this book can provide you with a baseline.
The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New
Rich by Timothy Ferriss. Regardless of whether you actually choose to
subscribe to the type of extreme lifestyle that Ferriss advocates, this book
will teach you two things. First, it shows what’s possible if you
relentlessly prioritize your work and focus on the 10% of effort that
produces most of your gains. Second, it drives home the importance of
creating sustainable systems with low maintenance. That’s a lesson that’s
often underemphasized in engineering, where our inclination to build new
features with the latest sexy technologies doesn’t necessarily take into
account the cost of future maintenance.
The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal
Change by Stephen R. Covey. I’m not actually a fan of Covey’s writing
style—much of it is a little too abstract and fluffy—but the lasting impact
of the ideas in the book compensate for it. From Covey’s third habit of
“putting first things first,” I learned that people tend to neglect important
but non-urgent activities and spend a lot of time dealing with tasks like
emails, phone calls, and meetings that may be urgent but ultimately
unimportant. A key takeaway from this habit is to explicitly budget time
to invest in yourself, whether it’s by learning new skills, maintaining
relationships, reading, etc.
Conscious Business: How to Build Value Through Values by Fred
Kofman. Kofman taught leadership seminars at companies like Facebook
and Google, and his book transformed how I approach difficult
conversations with others. Through simple language and well-constructed
hypotheticals, Kofman demonstrates that we often conflate the facts of a
situation and our own interpretations, resulting in unproductive
conversations. Only by separating fact from story can we actually have
those difficult conversations where we achieve our goals.
Your Brain at Work: Strategies for Overcoming Distraction, Regaining
Focus, and Working Smarter All Day Long by David Rock. In this easyto-read book, Rock combines research on the brain’s functions with
actionable advice on how to work more effectively around the brain’s
limitations. For instance, this book taught me that because prioritization is
a difficult but high-leverage activity that requires substantial cognitive
effort, it’s best done at the beginning of the day.
Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihály
Csíkszentmihályi. In this book, Csíkszentmihályi, a Hungarian professor
and the world’s leading researcher on positive psychology, summarizes
years of research on what’s required to make someone feel fulfilled and
motivated. Criteria include a quick feedback loop, an appropriate level of
challenge, and an absence of interruptions. Given how much time we
spend working, being conscious of these requirements as we go from job
to job and from project to project is very valuable.
Succeed: How We Can Reach Our Goals by Heidi Grant Halvorson.
Halvorson discusses different frameworks for thinking about goals and
how to best frame a goal to increase our chances of success. When is it
helpful to be optimistic versus pessimistic in a goal? Is it better to think
about why you want to achieve a certain goal, or to think about what steps
are necessary to achieve it? Should you visualize what you might gain
from achieving a goal or what you might lose by failing to achieve it? It
turns out that depending on the type of goal, different ways of mentally
framing the goal can significantly affect your chances for success.

effective engineer, was a book about how to make the best use of your time as a engineer, use leverage to cause greater impact, support your team and you in the same process, be part of the success. Ease onboarding progress, how interview processe can be improved. What kind of problems should you tackle, when & how you should automate, the process vs decision making (batch scripts), running simple scripts regularly to catch problems early on. Have enough time to run scripts say 5-10 minutes. And do check ups with longer intervals.
invest in the teams
figure out UNIX commands
get the fundamentals right, the core principles and basics, to speed up
little improvement a day goes a long way
don't overburden teams with more than 40 hours of work
it decreases productivity over the long term
be willing to give up in dire situations thus slow down, and learn from your mistakes
learn how to allocate time properly for products
break down the time
do procedural rewrites/refactoring, instead of doing it all out at once. Best is to incorporate the old and the new at the same time.

In 1998, Frank Schmidt and John Hunter published a meta-analysis of 85 years of research on how well assessments predict performance. They looked at 19 different assessment techniques and found that typical, unstructured job interviews were pretty bad at predicting how someone would perform once hired.

Unstructured interviews have an r2 of 0.14, meaning that they can explain only 14 percent of an employee’s performance. This is somewhat ahead of reference checks (explaining 7 percent of performance), ahead of the number of years of work experience (3 percent).

The best predictor of how someone will perform in a job is a work sample test (29 percent). This entails giving candidates a sample piece of work, similar to that which they would do in the job, and assessing their performance at it. Even this can’t predict performance perfectly, since actual performance also depends on other skills, such as how well you collaborate with others, adapt to uncertainty, and learn.

"And just as our products can always get better, so can our hiring
machine. We constantly review and work to balance our speed, error rate,
and quality of experience for candidates and Googlers. For example, Todd
Carlisle, now the HR leader for one of our business teams but at the time a
PhD analyst on our staffing team, looked at the question of whether having
up to twenty-five interviews per candidate was actually helpful or not. He
found that four interviews were enough to predict whether or not we should
hire someone with 86 percent confidence. Every additional interviewer after
the fourth added only 1 percent more predictive power. It simply wasn’t
worth the extra time for Google or the suffering for the candidate, so we
implemented a “Rule of Four,” limiting the number of interviews a
candidate could have on-site (though we allowed exceptions in certain
cases). That change alone shaved our median time to hire to 47 days,
compared to 90 to 180 days in the past, and has saved employees hundreds
of thousands of hours.

1. Be a good coach.

6. Help the team with career development.
7. Have a clear vision/strategy for the team.
8. Have important technical skills that help advise the team.

1. My manager gives me actionable feedback that helps me
improve my performance.
2. My manager does not “micromanage” (i.e., get involved in
details that should be handled at other levels).
3. My manager shows consideration for me as a person.
4. My manager keeps the team focused on our priority
results/deliverables.
5. My manager regularly shares relevant information from
his/her manager and senior leadership.
6. My manager has had a meaningful discussion with me about
my career development in the past six months.
7. My manager communicates clear goals for our team.
8. My manager has the technical expertise (e.g., coding in Tech,
accounting in Finance) required to effectively manage me.
9. I would recommend my manager to other Googlers.
Fortunately, there’s a much better approach to measuring the results of
learning programs, and like many great people-management ideas, it’s not a
new one. In 1959, Donald Kirkpatrick, who was a professor at the
University of Wisconsin and past president of the American Society for
Training and Development, came up with a model that prescribed four
levels of measurement in learning programs: reaction, learning, behavior,

1. Have a role-and-responsibilities discussion.
2. Match your Noogler with a peer buddy.
3. Help your Noogler build a social network.
4. Set up onboarding check-ins once a month for your Noogler’s first
six months.
5. Encourage open dialogue.

1. Ask questions, lots of questions!
2. Schedule regular 1:1s with your manager.
3. Get to know your team.
4. Actively solicit feedback—don’t wait for it!
5. Accept the challenge (i.e., take risks and don’t be afraid to fail…
other Googlers will support you).

"The best predictor of how someone will perform in a job is a work
sample test (29 percent). This entails giving candidates a sample piece of
work, similar to that which they would do in the job, and assessing their
performance at it. Even this can’t predict performance perfectly, since
actual performance also depends on other skills, such as how well you
collaborate with others, adapt to uncertainty, and learn. And worse, many
jobs don’t have nice, neat pieces of work that you can hand to a candidate.
You can (and should) offer a work sample test to someone applying to work
in a call center or to do very task-oriented work, but for many jobs there are
too many variables involved day-to-day to allow the construction of a
representative work sample.
All our technical hires, whether in engineering or product management,
go through a work sample test of sorts, where they are asked to solve
engineering problems during the interview. According to Urs Hölzle, “We
do our interviewing based on really testing your skills. Like, write some
code, explain this thing, right? Not look at your resume, but really see what
you can do.” Eric Veach adds, “The interviews are done [by] a large swath
of engineers who ask a lot of very data-oriented kinds of questions. They’re
not just, you know, ‘Tell me about a time when…’ They’re more like,
‘Write me an algorithm to do this.’ ”
The second-best predictors of performance are tests of general cognitive
ability (26 percent). In contrast to case interviews and brainteasers, these
are actual tests with defined right and wrong answers, similar to what you
might find on an IQ test. They are predictive because general cognitive
ability includes the capacity to learn, and the combination of raw
intelligence and learning ability will make most people successful in most
jobs. The problem, however, is that most standardized tests of this type
discriminate against non-white, non-male test takers (at least in the United
States). The SAT consistently underpredicts how women and non-whites
will perform in college. Phyllis Rosser’s 1989 study of the SAT compared
high school girls and boys of comparable ability and college performance,
and found that the girls scored lower on the SAT than the boys.86 Reasons
why include the test format (there is no gender gap on Advanced Placement
tests, which use short answers and essays instead of multiple choice); test
scoring (boys are more likely to guess after eliminating one possible
answer, which improves their scores); and even the content of questions
(“females did better on SAT questions about relationships, aesthetics, and
the humanities, while males did better on questions about sports, the
physical sciences, and business”).xxiv These kinds of studies have been
repeated multiple times, and while standardized tests of this sort have
gotten better, they are still not great.xxv
As a proof point, Pitzer College, a liberal arts college in Southern
California, made reporting test scores optional for applicants who had at
least a 3.5 grade point average (GPA) or were in the top 10 percent of their
high school classes. Since then, their average admitted-student GPA has
grown 8 percent and they’ve had a 58 percent increase in students of
color.
88
Tied with tests of general cognitive ability are structured interviews (26
percent), where candidates are asked a consistent set of questions with clear
criteria to assess the quality of responses. Structured interviews are used all
the time in survey research. The idea is that any variation in candidate
assessment is a result of the candidate’s performance, not because an
interviewer has higher or lower standards, or asks easier or harder
questions.
There are two kinds of structured interviews: behavioral and situational.
Behavioral interviews ask candidates to describe prior achievements and
match those to what is required in the current job (i.e., “Tell me about a
time…?”). Situational interviews present a job-related hypothetical
situation (i.e., “What would you do if…?”). A diligent interviewer will
probe deeply to assess the veracity and thought process behind the stories
told by the candidate.
Structured interviews are predictive even for jobs that are themselves
unstructured. We’ve also found that they cause both candidates and
interviewers to have a better experience and are perceived to be most fair.
89
So why don’t more companies use them? Well, they are hard to develop:
You have to write them, test them, and make sure interviewers stick to
them. And then you have to continuously refresh them so candidates don’t
compare notes and come prepared with all the answers. It’s a lot of work,
but the alternative is to waste everyone’s time with a typical interview that
is either highly subjective, or discriminatory, or both.
There is a better way. Research shows that combinations of assessment
techniques are better than any single technique. For example, a test of
general cognitive ability (predicts 26 percent of performance), when
combined with an assessment of conscientiousness (10 percent), is better
able to predict who will be successful in a job (36 percent). My experience
is that people who score high on conscientiousness “work to completion”—
meaning they don’t stop until a job is done rather than quitting at good
enough—and are more likely to feel responsibility for their teams and the
environment around them. In other words, they are more likely to act like
owners rather than employees. I remember being floored when Josh
O’Brien, a member of our tech-support team, was helping me with an IT
issue in my first month or so. It was a Friday, and when five o’clock rolled
around I told him we could finish on Monday. “That’s okay. We work to
completion,” he told me, and kept at it until my problem was resolved.90
So what assessment techniques do we use?
The goal of our interview process is to predict how c"
